Laravel Component for User with Roles

A simple and straightforward component on how to make a user with roles (with extra bonuses)

1. Create laravel project
2. Create migration for (roles, userHasRoles)
3. Create controller for creating roles
4. Create controller for assign roles (if user already exists in the userHasRoles model, update the role)
5. Create controller for admin to have access to create user and assigning their role (account registration handled by admin)
6. Done :D

You can use the role assignment within middleware and other controller function, have fun creating!
